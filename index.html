        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics Finance ðŸ’µ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, and my educational journey took me from my hometown to Berlin, Germany, where I completed high school at the Berlin Brandenburg International School (BBIS). My years at BBIS introduced me to the rigor and breadth of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, which played a significant role in shaping both my academic and personal growth. Throughout the IB curriculum, I honed critical skills in leadership, risk-taking, and time managementâ€”skills that I have found essential in all aspects of my academic and extracurricular life. Looking ahead, I am eager to further my education in economics, with a particular interest in understanding how economic theories can be used to address contemporary issues like income inequality, environmental sustainability, and global financial stability. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to meaningful solutions in these areas, using both the knowledge I have gained and the skills I continue to develop. My experiences so far have provided me with a strong foundation, and I am confident that they will enable me to make a positive impact in the field of economics and beyond.   <br><br>

        During my time at BBIS, I actively engaged in various school activities that allowed me to further develop my leadership abilities. As part of the IB program, I participated in collaborative projects where I took on leadership roles, learning to navigate group dynamics, motivate my peers, and make strategic decisions under pressure. These experiences taught me how to balance multiple perspectives, delegate tasks effectively, and ultimately drive projects toward success. Additionally, the IBâ€™s emphasis on risk-taking encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone, whether by exploring new academic fields, participating in debates, or engaging in community service. This openness to new experiences has broadened my worldview and instilled in me a flexible, adaptive approach to problem-solving.

One of the most valuable skills I acquired through the IB program was time management. Balancing the rigorous IB workload with extracurricular activities required me to become highly organized and efficient in my approach to tasks. I learned to prioritize effectively, set achievable goals, and manage my time to meet deadlines without compromising the quality of my work. These time-management skills have not only contributed to my academic success but have also become essential in other areas of my life, allowing me to take on multiple responsibilities with confidence and precision.
<br><br>

From a young age, I had a keen interest in economics, which deepened significantly during my high school years. My curiosity was driven by a fascination with how economic principles impact daily life, both on an individual and societal level. In economics classes, I excelled not only in understanding theoretical frameworks but also in applying them to real-world situations. This skill allowed me to make connections between what I learned in the classroom and contemporary global issues, such as market fluctuations, government policies, and international trade dynamics. This practical approach to economics gave me a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving, which I aim to continue building upon in my future studies and career.
